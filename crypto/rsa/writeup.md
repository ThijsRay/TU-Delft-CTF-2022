- Since e is almost the same size as of n, we can try the Boneh-Durfee attack
- We can use this [script](https://github.com/mimoo/RSA-and-LLL-attacks/blob/master/boneh_durfee.sage) to get the private exponent.
- Make sure to adjust the value of m and delta
- After getting the private exponent we can easily the flag
