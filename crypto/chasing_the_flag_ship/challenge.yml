# The extra field provides additional fields for data during the install/sync commands/
# Fields in extra can be used to supply additional information for other challenge types
# For example the follow extra field is for dynamic challenges. To use these following
# extra fields, set the type to "dynamic" and uncomment the "extra" section below

# Settings used for Dockerfile deployment
# If not used, remove or set to null
# If you have a Dockerfile set to .
# If you have an imaged hosted on Docker set to the image url (e.g. python/3.8:latest, registry.gitlab.com/python/3.8:latest)
# Follow Docker best practices and assign a tag
image: null
# Specify a host to deploy the challenge onto.
# The currently supported URI schemes are ssh:// and registry://
# ssh is an ssh URI where the above image will be copied to and deployed (e.g. ssh://root@123.123.123.123)
# registry is a Docker registry tag (e.g registry://registry.example.com/test/image)
# host can also be specified during the deploy process: `ctf challenge deploy challenge --host=ssh://root@123.123.123.123`
host: null

# Optional settings

# connection_info is used to provide a link, hostname, or instructions on how to connect to a challenge
connection_info: http://[2a02:c206:2101:8992::]/

# If connection_info was provided to CTFd when the challenge was installed, it will be passed to the healthcheck script:
# ./writeup/exploit.sh --connection-info "nc hostname 12345"
healthcheck: writeup/exploit.sh
